# madLibsApp
This is the exit assignment for Sprint 8, Assignment 14.2. Students will learn to code an app that asks users to supply mad-libs-styled words (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc) and stores their entries into a larger body of text. That text is then displayed on the page. 
To run the completed app, download this repo as a zip, unpack it into a folder and start the index.html file in your web browser
